            <p>"Learning to code is a lot like learning to cook:</p>
            <p>First, you watch someone else do it. </p>
            <p>Then you try it, and get it wrong.</p> 
            <p>You figure out how you got it wrong, then try it again. When you get it right, you've learned something!</p>
            <p>Once you've learned a few things, you throw them together and make something new!</p>
            <p>Congratulations, your new career has begun."</p>

                Been a programmer for like six months. I've written one calculator app with a hint of personality and i'm in the middle of writing a turn based combat game whose scope has flown straight out of control. Seems to be coming back into line though.

            <li>
                Was a chef for ten years - experience over qualifications matter here. I can't lie - I really miss it. Arthritis takes no prisoners though, it seems.

                Was a hairdresser for seven... we don't talk about that any more. It's not even on my CV, I just put down that I had a myriad of menial jobs‚Ä¶

        <p> Okay, so I've been forced by accepted porfolio and self-aggrandisation norms that I add some social links here. I don't actually have a social presence, so all I can offer is a link to my GitHub and LinkedIn - I'll throw in the home pages of Reddit and Twitter to pad things out a bit. </p>
